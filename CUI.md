### Language of UI Design
When thinking, implementing and collaborating with graphic designers and information architects, it's helpful to share a common language. And as common practice, companies create [design language systems](https://uxplanet.orgdesign-language-system-d438f4aa30e0) (DLS) that can be used to create an very large amount of **content** from assembling **components** to generate a uniform or consistent [aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics):

 * **App Bar** - Displays information and actions relating to the current screen
 * **Chips** - Compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action
 * **Navigation**
    * _Bottom_ - Allows movement between primary destination within an application
    * _Top_ - Allows back and forth between pages
* **Buttons** - Allows users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.  
* **Dialogs** - Informs users about a task and can cont critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple task.
